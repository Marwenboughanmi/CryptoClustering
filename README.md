# CryptoClustering
-Clustering the crypto coin data using KMeans on the original scaled data and using Principal Component Analysis.
-Scaled the data  and inertia is calculated to find the best value for k using the original scaled data. The best value for k according to the elbow plot was 4.
-Using PCA data, and calculating inertia again, the best value for k was once again 4.
-Calculating the weights of the features to show which features had the most influence on each component.
